# tcr-sequencing

## Initial project description:
From Elana Fertig: What would you think of doing a ML project in TCR-sequencing methods?
We are interested in how motifs in sequences change in transitions with T-cells learned from scRNA-seq data (a different data modality). 
I think itâ€™ll combine seem unsupervised / time course learning methods with motif finding in sequences of letters that may be perfect for your background.
